# Fiverr UI Clone with React

This is a Fiverr UI Clone with React. This project is a part of my React learning process. I have tried to clone the Fiverr UI as much as possible. I have used React, React Router Dom, Framer Motion, Infinite React Carousel, classNames, SCSS, and other libraries. If you want to use this project, you can use it for learning purposes. I will be happy if you can give me a star. _Thank you_ 😊.
